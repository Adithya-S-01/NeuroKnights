The repository contains, csv files, front-end programs,and followed by python to connect the website with machine learning algorithms.
We have used two machine learning models:
1. one for predicting the gold prices using random forest algorithm.
2. This is to group the users based on their risk taking levels using Random forest and KNN algorithms.
